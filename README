The repository for the Argo Vs MongoDB revisit.

The files that I've written on my own or modified are the following:
1) nobench_gen_data.py
* Modified data generation method to include deeply nested objects and larger objects.
2) mongodriver.py, query.py, mongoqueries.py, argoqueries.py
* This is the overall testing suite that includes the queries for both systems, as well as the timing and data-loading mechanism.
3) json2bulksql.py
* This file has been modified in order to allow large JSON documents to be converted into the appropriate text files for DBMS-loading.

Further changes for benchmark of extended Argo, vs Mongo 3.0, vs PSQL 9.4 native JSONB data type:

1) various code cleanups
2) rename mongodriver.py to benchdriver.py
